{"name":"QMT","tagline":"QCD support for Multi-Threads","body":"QMT is a software library providing OpenMP like fork-join multi-thread APIs. The current implementation works on i386 and x86-64 using pthread and other optimizations.\r\n\r\n### Documentation and User Information\r\nThere is a [paper](http://www.jlab.org/hpc/papers/hpcasia07.pdf) published in the Proceedings of 9th International Conference on High Performance Computing in Asia Pacific Region (HPC-Asia 2007) that describes the implementation of the barriers, a later [paper](http://usqcd.jlab.org/usqcd-docs/qmt/nas2008sub.pdf) that describes the performance on the AMD quad-core processors, and a recent [talk](http://usqcd.jlab.org/usqcd-docs/qmt/multicoretalk.pdf) on the implementation as well.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
